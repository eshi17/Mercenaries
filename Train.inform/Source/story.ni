Train Station is a room.

Car 1 is a room. Car 1 is south of Train Station.

The big door is a door. The big door is north of Car 1. The big Door is open.
	After going south from Train Station:
		Now the big door is closed;
		say "the door slides shut just as your leap into the car.";
		Continue the action.
Instead of opening big door, say "But the train is moving."
