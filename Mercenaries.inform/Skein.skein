You wake up to shouts and loud banging. It is early; the sun has just begun to rise. After groggily getting out from bed, you peer out the window. There is a crowd of people gathered outside in front of the Mayor&apos;s House.  It&apos;s too early! What is happening?

Mercenaries
An Interactive Fiction by Elana Shi
Release 1 / Serial number 141019 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Cottage
A small one room compartment. Shoved into the corner of the room is your bed. Next to the door is your sorry excuse of a kitchen: a small stove, and a sink. At the center of the room is a squat wooden table with the stone on it. On the wall above your sink is a small one way window that looks into Town Square. You can go to Town Square by going East.

But then the Company discovered the precious materials, and began digging deep into the villager&apos;s farms. There, they found masses of the Lady&apos;s Flower, which they called Charoite. Shortly after, they offered a huge sum of money to the town&apos;s mayor, hoping that he would allow the Company to keep digging. The mayor refused.
