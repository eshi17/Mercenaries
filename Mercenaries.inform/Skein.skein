You wake up to shouts and loud banging. It is early; the sun has just begun to rise. After groggily getting out from bed, you peer out the window. What you see surprises you: the mayor and some villagers are fighting off a group of men in suits. Who are these men? Where did they come from? No. Those are unnecessary questions. It must be the Company.

Cottage
A small one room compartment. Shoved into the corner of the room is your bed. Next to the door is your sorry excuse of a kitchen: a small stove, and a sink. At the center of the room is a squat wooden table with the stone on it. On the wall above your sink is a small one way window that looks into Town Square.

    <result xml:space="preserve">The townspeople call it Lady&apos;s Flower. The opaque material is an intense purple, mixed with grays and whites. The colors swirls into intricate patterns that almost look artificially enhanced. Just two years ago, there were only a couple of stones that a select few families held. But then the Company discovered the precious materials, and began digging deep into the villager&apos;s farms. There, they found masses of the Lady&apos;s Flower, which they called Charoite. Shortly after, they offered a huge sum of money to the town&apos;s mayor, hoping that he would allow the Company to keep digging. The mayor refused.
