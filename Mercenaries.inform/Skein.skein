You wake up to shouts and loud banging. It is early; the sun has just begun to rise. After groggily getting out from bed, you peer out the window. There is a crowd of people gathered outside, in front of the Mayor&apos;s House.

Mercenaries
An Interactive Fiction by Elana Shi
Release 1 / Serial number 141028 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Cottage
A small one room compartment. Shoved into the corner of the room is your bed. Next to the door is your sorry excuse of a kitchen: a small stove, and a sink. At the center of the room is a squat wooden table. On the wall above your sink is a small one way window that looks into Town Square. You can go to Town Square by going East.

Town Square
A square plaza with a cobblestone ground. Along the sides of the square are many two-story buildings. At the center of the square is a tall stone fountain, encircled by several wooden benches. Your cottage is to the West. East is the Mayor&apos;s House. There is a crowd gathered outside the Mayor&apos;s House.

&quot;Him,&quot; he points to Edgar. &quot;He just informed us that the Company has Felix.&quot;

You are taken aback. They have Felix?

&quot;Your son, Felix?&quot;

&quot;Who else?!&quot; The mayor cries angrily. &quot;They want the damn rocks! Now they&apos;ve resorted to this trickery and blackmailing. What villains!&quot;

&quot;What can we do?&quot; You ask earnestly.

&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; he says as he shakes his head, &quot;Why don&apos;t we go into the house to speak.&quot;

&quot;Alright.&quot; The mayor turns to Edgar and says in his booming voice,

&quot;Enough!&quot; The crowd goes silent. &quot;Edgar. We will give you an answer soon. In the meantime, at least tell me where my son is.&quot;

Edgar laughs. &quot;Now? Probably on the way to the City. I will await your reply,&quot; he cackles as he walks away. The mob of villagers glare at Edgar, as he arrogantly strides away. When he is out of sight, the villagers begin to head back to their homes, grumbling to themselves.

You turn to the Mayor and he unlocks the door to his house. You follow him into the spacious mansion.

Mayor&apos;s House
When you walk into the house, you are stunned by the beautiful furnishing that seems to glitter in the house. At the center of the pearly marble white floor is a large glossy wooden dining table, on top of which is an elegant flower arrangement. Under a magnificent acrylic painting is a polished large leather sofa. The Mayor plops down on the sofa and deflates.

Station
The Station is slow and idle. The town is not an attraction, and the Station is merely a stop for business men who need work in the city, or visit home. You see only a few business men walking around, luggages in tow. Prominently in the center of the station is a large faded red ticket booth. Next to it is a small kiosk, selling beverages and food items. To the south is the Train, waiting to depart.  Leaning against one of the pillars is a tall lanky boy, who you recognize instantly: Felix. Next to him is a man in a black suit, who Felix merrily jokes with. What in the world?

&quot;You don&apos;t understand. Right now the Company has told your father that they are holding you in their custody. They said that if the villagers don&apos;t yield the Lady&apos;s Flower, they&apos;ll harm you.&quot;

&quot;Don&apos;t joke with me. That old fart&apos;s probably willing to say anything to get me back to the village. And once they do, they&apos;ll never let me leave again.&quot;

&quot;You shut up! If the villagers do end up handing over the stones, they&apos;ll catch up and toss you back into the village. Please Felix, come to your sense.&quot;

&quot;No! I can&apos;t stay there. Even if your story is true, the villagers would never hand over the stupid rocks. They have too much prided for that!&quot; The speakers in the Station suddenly blare out:

&quot;Train 342 to the City is departing in 5 minutes-please board now. Thank you.&quot; Felix looks at you, then shoves you out of the way to gather his belongings.

&quot;Sorry, boy. Tickets are all sold out. Budget cuts, ya know? They&apos;re limiting passengers to lighten the load.&quot; You raise your brow. Budget cuts?

&quot;This is really important. The Company&apos;s done something real bad this time.&quot;

&quot;Sorry, boy. Tickets are all sold out. Budget cuts, ya know? They&apos;re limiting passengers to lighten the load.&quot; You raise your brow. Budget cuts?

&quot;This is really important. The Company&apos;s done something real bad this time.&quot;

But then the Company discovered the precious materials, and began digging deep into the villager&apos;s farms. There, they found masses of the Cloud Stone, which they called Charoite. Shortly after, they offered a huge sum of money to the town&apos;s mayor, hoping that he would allow the Company to keep digging. The mayor refused.

You are taken aback. They have Felix?

&quot;What can we do?&quot; You ask earnestly.

&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; he says as he shakes his head, &quot;Why don&apos;t we go into the house to speak.&quot;

&quot;Alright.&quot; The mayor turns to Edgar and says in his booming voice,

&quot;Enough!&quot; The crowd goes silent. &quot;Edgar. We will give you an answer soon. In the meantime, at least tell me where my son is.&quot;

Edgar laughs. &quot;Now? Probably on the way to the City. I will await your reply,&quot; he cackles as he walks away. The mob of villagers glare at Edgar, as he arrogantly strides away. When he is out of sight, the villagers begin to head back to their homes, grumbling to themselves.

You turn to the Mayor and he unlocks the door to his house. You follow him into the spacious mansion.

Mayor&apos;s House
When you walk into the house, you are stunned by the beautiful furnishing that seems to glitter in the house. At the center of the pearly marble white floor is a large glossy wooden table. Under a magnificent acrylic painting is a polished large leather sofa. The Mayor plops down on the sofa and deflates.

Station
The Station is slow and idle. The town is not an attraction, and the Station is merely a stop for business men who need work in the city, or visit home. You see only a few business men walking around, luggages in tow. Prominently in the center of the station is a large faded red ticket booth. Next to it is a small kiosk, selling beverages and food items. To the south is the Train, waiting to depart.  Leaning against one of the pillars is a tall lanky boy, who you recognize instantly: Felix. Next to him is a man in a black suit, who Felix merrily jokes with. What in the world?

The Station is slow and idle. The town is not an attraction, and the Station is merely a stop for business men who need work in the city, or visit home.

Next to it is a small kiosk, selling beverages and food items. To the south is the Train, waiting to depart.  Leaning against one of the pillars is a tall lanky boy, who you recognize instantly: Felix. Next to him is a man in a black suit, who Felix merrily jokes with. What in the world?

Behind the counter sits a bored woman. On closer inspection, you realize that the woman is a villager named Rita.

&quot;Sorry, boy. Tickets are all sold out. Budget cuts, ya know? They&apos;re limiting passengers to lighten the load.&quot; You raise your brow. Budget cuts?

&quot;This is really important. The Company&apos;s done something real bad this time.&quot;

&quot;$20 dollahs.&quot;

&quot;20!? That&apos;s daylight robbery!&quot; Ignoring you, she grabs a piece of scrap paper from her cluttered desk and scrawls something on it.

You are taken aback. They have Felix?

&quot;Alright.&quot; The mayor turns to Edgar and says in his booming voice,

&quot;Enough!&quot; The crowd goes silent. &quot;Edgar. We will give you an answer soon. In the meantime, at least tell me where my son is.&quot;

Edgar laughs. &quot;Now? Probably on the way to the City. I will await your reply,&quot; he cackles as he walks away. The mob of villagers glare at Edgar, as he arrogantly strides away. When he is out of sight, the villagers begin to head back to their homes, grumbling to themselves.

You turn to the Mayor and he unlocks the door to his house. You follow him into the spacious mansion.

Mayor&apos;s House
When you walk into the house, you are stunned by the beautiful furnishing that seems to glitter in the house. At the center of the pearly marble white floor is a large glossy wooden table. Under a magnificent acrylic painting is a polished large leather sofa. The Mayor plops down on the sofa and deflates.

Station
The Station is slow and idle. The town is not an attraction, and the Station is merely a stop for business men who need work in the city, or visit home. You see only a few business men walking around, luggages in tow. Prominently in the center of the station is a large faded red ticket booth. Next to it is a small kiosk, selling beverages and food items. To the south is the Train, waiting to depart.  Leaning against one of the pillars is a tall lanky boy, who you recognize instantly: Felix. Next to him is a man in a black suit, who Felix merrily jokes with. What in the world?

Luckily, the Company realized this and offered to relocate me. They&apos;re bringing me to the city, it&apos;s going to be wonderful!&quot;

&quot;You don&apos;t understand. Right now the Company has told your father that they are holding you in their custody. They said that if the villagers don&apos;t yield all of the Cloud Stones, they&apos;ll harm you.&quot;

&quot;Don&apos;t joke with me. That old fart&apos;s probably willing to say anything to get me back to the village. And once they do, they&apos;ll never let me leave again.&quot;

&quot;Shut up! If the villagers do end up handing over the stones, they&apos;ll capture you and toss you back into the village. Please Felix, come to your senses.&quot;

&quot;No! I can&apos;t stay there. Even if your story is true, the villagers would never hand over the stupid rocks. They have too much pride for that!&quot; The speakers in the Station suddenly blare out:

&quot;Train 342 to the City is departing in 10 minutes-please board now. Thank you.&quot; Felix looks at you, then shoves you out of the way to gather his belongings.

A cramped single toilet room with one toilet and one sink. Opposite of the door is an open window. At the center of the bathroom is a horrible sight: Felix&apos;s body is sprawled out on the floor. He is dead.

&quot;Him,&quot; he points to Edgar. &quot;He just informed us that the Company has Felix.&quot;

You are taken aback. They have Felix?

&quot;Your son, Felix?&quot;

&quot;Who else?!&quot; The mayor cries angrily. &quot;They want the damn rocks! Now they&apos;ve resorted to this trickery and blackmailing. What villains!&quot;

&quot;What can we do?&quot; You ask earnestly.

&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; he says as he shakes his head, &quot;Why don&apos;t we go into the house to speak.&quot;

&quot;Alright.&quot; The mayor turns to Edgar and says in his booming voice,

&quot;Enough!&quot; The crowd goes silent. &quot;Edgar. We will give you an answer soon. In the meantime, at least tell me where my son is.&quot;

Edgar laughs. &quot;Now? Probably on the way to the City. I will await your reply,&quot; he cackles as he walks away. The mob of villagers glare at Edgar, as he arrogantly strides away. When he is out of sight, the villagers begin to head back to their homes, grumbling to themselves.

You turn to the Mayor and he unlocks the door to his house. You follow him into the spacious mansion.

Mayor&apos;s House
When you walk into the house, you are stunned by the beautiful furnishing that seems to glitter in the house. At the center of the pearly marble white floor is a large glossy wooden table. Under a magnificent acrylic painting is a polished large leather sofa. The Mayor plops down on the sofa and deflates.

Station
The Station is slow and idle. The town is not an attraction, and the Station is merely a stop for business men who need work in the city, or visit home. You see only a few business men walking around, luggages in tow. Prominently in the center of the station is a large faded red ticket booth. Next to it is a small kiosk, selling beverages and food items. To the south is the Train, waiting to depart.  Leaning against one of the pillars is a tall lanky boy, who you recognize instantly: Felix. Next to him is a man in a black suit, who Felix merrily jokes with. What in the world?

You can see Black Suit and Felix here.

&quot;This is really important. The Company&apos;s done something real bad this time.&quot;

At the top of the train, you feel very unsafe. However, as you gaze at your surroundings, you are struck with admiration of the beautiful landscape. In front of you, there is a long stretch of white panels that is the roof. You notice that there is a metal rod running across the edges of each car.

You are taken aback. They have Felix?

&quot;Your son, Felix?&quot;

&quot;Who else?!&quot; The mayor cries angrily. &quot;They want the damn rocks! Now they&apos;ve resorted to this trickery and blackmailing. What villains!&quot;

&quot;What can we do?&quot; You ask earnestly.

&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; he says as he shakes his head, &quot;Why don&apos;t we go into the house to speak.&quot;

&quot;Alright.&quot; The mayor turns to Edgar and says in his booming voice,

&quot;Enough!&quot; The crowd goes silent. &quot;Edgar. We will give you an answer soon. In the meantime, at least tell me where my son is.&quot;

Edgar laughs. &quot;Now? Probably on the way to the City. I will await your reply,&quot; he cackles as he walks away. The mob of villagers glare at Edgar, as he arrogantly strides away. When he is out of sight, the villagers begin to head back to their homes, grumbling to themselves.

You turn to the Mayor and he unlocks the door to his house. You follow him into the spacious mansion.

Mayor&apos;s House
When you walk into the house, you are stunned by the beautiful furnishing that seems to glitter in the house. At the center of the pearly marble white floor is a large glossy wooden table. Under a magnificent acrylic painting is a polished large leather sofa. The Mayor plops down on the sofa and deflates.

Station
The Station is slow and idle. The town is not an attraction, and the Station is merely a stop for business men who need work in the city, or visit home. You see only a few business men walking around, luggages in tow. Prominently in the center of the station is a large faded red ticket booth. Next to it is a small kiosk, selling beverages and food items. To the south is the Train, waiting to depart.  Leaning against one of the pillars is a tall lanky boy, who you recognize instantly: Felix. Next to him is a man in a black suit, who Felix merrily jokes with. What in the world?

You can see Black Suit and Felix here.

Mayor&apos;s House
When you walk into the house, you are stunned by the beautiful furnishing that seems to glitter in the house. At the center of the pearly marble white floor is a large glossy wooden dining table, on top of which is an elegant flower arrangement. Under a magnificent acrylic painting is a polished large leather sofa. The Mayor plops down on the sofa and deflates.
