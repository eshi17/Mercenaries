You wake up to shouts and loud banging. It is early; the sun has just begun to rise. After groggily getting out from bed, you peer out the window. There is a crowd of people gathered outside in front of the Mayor&apos;s House.  It&apos;s too early! What is happening?

Mercenaries
An Interactive Fiction by Elana Shi
Release 1 / Serial number 141022 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Cottage
A small one room compartment. Shoved into the corner of the room is your bed. Next to the door is your sorry excuse of a kitchen: a small stove, and a sink. At the center of the room is a squat wooden table with the stone on it. On the wall above your sink is a small one way window that looks into Town Square. You can go to Town Square by going East.

&quot;Him,&quot; he points to Edgar. &quot;He just informed us that the Company has Felix.&quot;

You are taken aback. They have Felix?

&quot;Your son, Felix?&quot;

&quot;Who else?!&quot; The mayor cries angrily. &quot;They want the damn rocks! Now they&apos;ve resorted to this trickery and blackmailing. What villains!&quot;

&quot;What can we do?&quot; You ask earnestly.

&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; he says as he shakes his head, &quot;Why don&apos;t we go into the house to speak.&quot;

&quot;Alright.&quot; The mayor turns to Edgar and says in his booming voice,

&quot;Enough!&quot; The crowd goes silent. &quot;Edgar. We will give you an answer soon. In the meantime, at least tell me where my son is.&quot;

Edgar laughs. &quot;Now? Probably on the way to the Station. I will await your reply,&quot; he cackles as he walks away. The mob of villagers glare at Edgar, as he arrogantly strides away. When he is out of sight, the villagers begin to head back to their homes, grumbling to themselves.

You turn to the Mayor and he unlocks the door to his house. You follow him into the spacious mansion.

Mayor&apos;s House
When you walk into the house, you are stunned by the beautiful furnishing that seems to glitter in the house. At the center of the pearly marble white floor is a large glossy wooden table, on top of which is an elegant flower arrangement. Under a magnificent acrylic painting is a polished stone bench. Sitting on the bench is a worried-looking woman. She is the Mayor&apos;s wife, Annabelle.

Our Lady only knows what they would do if I walked away from the town. Please go to the Station and save my son.&quot; You nod dutifully, and walk to the exit.

&quot;Please take this,&quot; Annabelle says in a pale whisper, as she hands you a small velvet box.

Station
The Station is slow and idle. The town is not an attraction, and the Station is merely a stop for business men who need work in the city, or visit home. You see only a few people walking around, luggages in tow. Prominently in the center of the station is a large faded red ticket booth. Next to it is a small kiosk, selling beverages and food items. To the south is the Train, waiting to depart.  Leaning against one of the pillars is a tall lanky boy, who you recognize instantly: Felix. On either side of him are men in black suits, who Felix merrily jokes with. What in the world?

&quot;Marcus. You know, same old same old. How&apos;s ya mother? She good?&quot; You nod.

&quot;Yep. Uh, listen Rita. I need a ticket onto that train over there. How much does it cost?&quot;

&quot;Sorry, boy. Tickets are all sold out. Budget cuts, ya know? They&apos;re limiting passengers to lighten the load.&quot; You raise your brow. Budget cuts?

&quot;This is really important. The Company&apos;s done something real bad this time.&quot;

&quot;The Company?&quot; Rita&apos;s eyes bulge, &quot;Oh dear. Uh... Oh! You see the Conductor over there? Sometimes he allows some extra people onto the train in exchange for something in return. Ya know what I mean?&quot;

&quot;How much?&quot;

&quot;$20 dollahs.&quot;

&quot;20!? That&apos;s daylight robbery!&quot; She grabs a piece of scrap paper from her cluttered desk and scrawls something on it.

&quot;Enough!&quot; The crowd goes silent. &quot;Edgar. We will give you an answer soon. In the meantime, at least tell me where my son is.&quot;

Edgar laughs. &quot;Now? Probably on the way to the Station. I will await your reply,&quot; he cackles as he walks away. The mob of villagers glare at Edgar, as he arrogantly strides away. When he is out of sight, the villagers begin to head back to their homes, grumbling to themselves.

You turn to the Mayor and he unlocks the door to his house. You follow him into the spacious mansion.

Mayor&apos;s House
When you walk into the house, you are stunned by the beautiful furnishing that seems to glitter in the house. At the center of the pearly marble white floor is a large glossy wooden table, on top of which is an elegant flower arrangement. Under a magnificent acrylic painting is a polished stone bench. Sitting on the bench is a worried-looking woman. She is the Mayor&apos;s wife, Annabelle.

Town Square
A square plaza with a cobblestone ground. Along the sides of the square are many two-story buildings. At the center of the square is a tall stone fountain, encircled by several wooden benches. Your cottage is to the West. East is the Mayor&apos;s House, and South is the Station. There is a crowd gathered outside the Mayor&apos;s door.

The Station is slow and idle. The town is not an attraction, and the Station is merely a stop for business men who need work in the city, or visit home. You see only a few people walking around, luggages in tow. Prominently in the center of the station is a large faded red ticket booth. Next to it is a small kiosk, selling beverages and food items. To the south is the Train, waiting to depart.  Leaning against one of the pillars is a tall lanky boy, who you recognize instantly: Felix.

Cottage
A small one room compartment. Shoved into the corner of the room is your bed. Next to the door is your sorry excuse of a kitchen: a small stove, and a sink. At the center of the room is a squat wooden table with the stone on it. On the wall above your sink is a small one way window that looks into Town Square. You can go to Town Square by going East.

Train Station
The train station is slow and idle. The town is not an attraction, and the train station is merely a stop for business men who need work in the city, or visit home. You see only a few people walking around, luggages in tow. Prominently in the center of the station is a large faded red ticket booth. Next to it is a small kiosk, selling beverages and food items.  Leaning against one of the pillars is a tall lanky boy, who you recognize instantly: Felix. On either side of him are men in black suits, who Felix merrily jokes with. What in the world?

    <result xml:space="preserve">You firmly place the paper scrap onto the kiosk desk. The man looks up from his book, and takes it. He unfolds the paper, and the corner of his mouth tugs upward. He turns to the cash register, and takes out a wad of cash, carefully counting it before he hands it to you. He does not say a word, and returns to his book.

&quot;Alrighty. You&apos;re good to go!&quot; You cringe on the inside. This corruption is not unfamiliar to you, but to engage in it yourself... that&apos;s wrong. &quot;ALL ABOARD!&quot; He yells. And steps inside the Train.

The Station is slow and idle. The town is not an attraction, and the Station is merely a stop for business men who need work in the city, or visit home. You see only a few people walking around, luggages in tow. Prominently in the center of the station is a large faded red ticket booth. Next to it is a small kiosk, selling beverages and food items. To the south is the Train, waiting to depart.

Town Square
A square plaza with a cobblestone ground. Along the sides of the square are many two-story buildings. At the center of the square is a tall stone fountain, encircled by several wooden benches. Your cottage is to the West. East is the Mayor&apos;s House, and South is the Station. There is a crowd gathered outside the Mayor&apos;s door.

    <result xml:space="preserve">the Sliding Door slid shut just as you leap into the Train Entrance car. You hear the train whir to life. Suddenly, you feel yourself stumble backwards, and find that outside, the scenery begins flying past. You hear the Conductor&apos;s voice again: &quot;Hello everybody. We are now headed to the City. Relax, and enjoy your time during this journey.&quot;

Train Entrance
A rather small room with little furnishing. There is a small table with a few pamphlets on it. The walls of the Entrance room are mostly glass windows.

You can see Sir Allan and Luna here.
