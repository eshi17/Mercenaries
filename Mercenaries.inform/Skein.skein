You wake up to shouts and loud banging. It is early; the sun has just begun to rise. After groggily getting out from bed, you peer out the window. There is a crowd of people gathered outside, in front of the Mayor&apos;s House.

Mercenaries
An Interactive Fiction by Elana Shi
Release 1 / Serial number 141028 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Cottage
A small one room compartment. Shoved into the corner of the room is your bed. Next to the door is your sorry excuse of a kitchen: a small stove, and a sink. At the center of the room is a squat wooden table with the stone on it. On the wall above your sink is a small one way window that looks into Town Square. You can go to Town Square by going East.

Town Square
A square plaza with a cobblestone ground. Along the sides of the square are many two-story buildings. At the center of the square is a tall stone fountain, encircled by several wooden benches. Your cottage is to the West. East is the Mayor&apos;s House. There is a crowd gathered outside the Mayor&apos;s House.

&quot;Him,&quot; he points to Edgar. &quot;He just informed us that the Company has Felix.&quot;

You are taken aback. They have Felix?

&quot;Your son, Felix?&quot;

&quot;Who else?!&quot; The mayor cries angrily. &quot;They want the damn rocks! Now they&apos;ve resorted to this trickery and blackmailing. What villains!&quot;

&quot;What can we do?&quot; You ask earnestly.

&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; he says as he shakes his head, &quot;Why don&apos;t we go into the house to speak.&quot;

&quot;Alright.&quot; The mayor turns to Edgar and says in his booming voice,

&quot;Enough!&quot; The crowd goes silent. &quot;Edgar. We will give you an answer soon. In the meantime, at least tell me where my son is.&quot;

Edgar laughs. &quot;Now? Probably on the way to the City. I will await your reply,&quot; he cackles as he walks away. The mob of villagers glare at Edgar, as he arrogantly strides away. When he is out of sight, the villagers begin to head back to their homes, grumbling to themselves.

You turn to the Mayor and he unlocks the door to his house. You follow him into the spacious mansion.

Mayor&apos;s House
When you walk into the house, you are stunned by the beautiful furnishing that seems to glitter in the house. At the center of the pearly marble white floor is a large glossy wooden table. Under a magnificent acrylic painting is a polished large leather sofa. The Mayor plops down on the sofa and deflates.

&quot;Yes,&quot; he murmurs, &quot;We should. Alex, I need you to chase my son. I am well past my prime, and cannot leave the villagers. Heaven only knows what they would do if I walked away from the town. Please go to the Station and save my son.&quot; You nod dutifully, and walk to the exit.

Station
The Station is slow and idle. The town is not an attraction, and the Station is merely a stop for business men who need work in the city, or visit home. You see only a few business men walking around, luggages in tow. Prominently in the center of the station is a large faded red ticket booth. Next to it is a small kiosk, selling beverages and food items. To the south is the Train, waiting to depart.  Leaning against one of the pillars is a tall lanky boy, who you recognize instantly: Felix. Next to him is a man in a black suit, who Felix merrily jokes with. What in the world?

You can see Black Suit and Felix here.

&quot;Alex. You know, same old same old. How&apos;s ya mother? She good?&quot; You nod.

&quot;Yep. Uh, listen Rita. I need a ticket onto that train over there. How much does it cost?&quot;

&quot;Sorry, boy. Tickets are all sold out. Budget cuts, ya know? They&apos;re limiting passengers to lighten the load.&quot; You raise your brow. Budget cuts?

&quot;This is really important. The Company&apos;s done something real bad this time.&quot;

&quot;The Company?&quot; Rita&apos;s eyes bulge, &quot;Oh dear. Uh... Oh! You see the Conductor over there? Sometimes he allows some extra people onto the train in exchange for something in return. Ya know what I mean?&quot;

&quot;How much?&quot;

&quot;$20 dollahs.&quot;

&quot;20!? That&apos;s daylight robbery!&quot; Ignoring you, she grabs a piece of scrap paper from her cluttered desk and scrawls something on it.

Bathroom
A cramped single toilet room with one toilet and one sink. At the center of the bathroom is a horrible sight: Felix&apos;s body is sprawled out on the floor. He is dead.  Out of the corner of your eye, you notice a small glimmer in Felix&apos;s palm. You carefully pick it up and discover that it is a small jewel.

You are taken aback. They have Felix?

&quot;Your son, Felix?&quot;

&quot;Who else?!&quot; The mayor cries angrily. &quot;They want the damn rocks! Now they&apos;ve resorted to this trickery and blackmailing. What villains!&quot;

&quot;What can we do?&quot; You ask earnestly.

&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; he says as he shakes his head, &quot;Why don&apos;t we go into the house to speak.&quot;

&quot;Alright.&quot; The mayor turns to Edgar and says in his booming voice,

&quot;Enough!&quot; The crowd goes silent. &quot;Edgar. We will give you an answer soon. In the meantime, at least tell me where my son is.&quot;

Edgar laughs. &quot;Now? Probably on the way to the City. I will await your reply,&quot; he cackles as he walks away. The mob of villagers glare at Edgar, as he arrogantly strides away. When he is out of sight, the villagers begin to head back to their homes, grumbling to themselves.

You turn to the Mayor and he unlocks the door to his house. You follow him into the spacious mansion.

Mayor&apos;s House
When you walk into the house, you are stunned by the beautiful furnishing that seems to glitter in the house. At the center of the pearly marble white floor is a large glossy wooden dining table, on top of which is an elegant flower arrangement. Under a magnificent acrylic painting is a polished large leather sofa. The Mayor plops down on the sofa and deflates.

    <result xml:space="preserve">&quot;Mayor, I think we need to hurry.&quot; The Mayor closes his eyes.

&quot;Yes,&quot; he murmurs, &quot;We should. Alex, I need you to chase my son. I am well past my prime, and cannot leave the villagers. Our Lady only knows what they would do if I walked away from the town. Please go to the Station and save my son.&quot; You nod dutifully, and walk to the exit.

Station
The Station is slow and idle. The town is not an attraction, and the Station is merely a stop for business men who need work in the city, or visit home. You see only a few business men walking around, luggages in tow. Prominently in the center of the station is a large faded red ticket booth. Next to it is a small kiosk, selling beverages and food items. To the south is the Train, waiting to depart.  Leaning against one of the pillars is a tall lanky boy, who you recognize instantly: Felix. Next to him is a man in a black suit, who Felix merrily jokes with. What in the world?

&quot;You ignorant boy. What are you doing?&quot; You shout at him.

&quot;I&apos;m going to the city, Alex,&quot; he retorts. &quot;I&apos;m sick of that stupid village. I don&apos;t want to inherit the position of mayor when I have the potential to do so much more. Luckily, the Company realized this and offered to relocate me. They&apos;re bringing me to the city, it&apos;s going to be wonderful!&quot;

&quot;You don&apos;t understand. Right now the Company has told your father that they are holding you in their custody. They said that if the villagers don&apos;t yield the Lady&apos;s Flower, they&apos;ll harm you.&quot;

&quot;Don&apos;t joke with me. That old fart&apos;s probably willing to say anything to get me back to the village. And once they do, they&apos;ll never let me leave again.&quot;

&quot;You shut up! If the villagers do end up handing over the stones, they&apos;ll catch up and toss you back into the village. Please Felix, come to your sense.&quot;

&quot;No! I can&apos;t stay there. Even if your story is true, the villagers would never hand over the stupid rocks. They have too much prided for that!&quot; The speakers in the Station suddenly blare out:

&quot;Train 342 to the City is departing in 5 minutes-please board now. Thank you.&quot; Felix looks at you, then shoves you out of the way to gather his belongings.

&quot;This is really important. The Company&apos;s done something real bad this time.&quot;

You are taken aback. They have Felix?

&quot;Your son, Felix?&quot;

&quot;Who else?!&quot; The mayor cries angrily. &quot;They want the damn rocks! Now they&apos;ve resorted to this trickery and blackmailing. What villains!&quot;

&quot;What can we do?&quot; You ask earnestly.

&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; he says as he shakes his head, &quot;Why don&apos;t we go into the house to speak.&quot;

&quot;Alright.&quot; The mayor turns to Edgar and says in his booming voice,

&quot;Enough!&quot; The crowd goes silent. &quot;Edgar. We will give you an answer soon. In the meantime, at least tell me where my son is.&quot;

Edgar laughs. &quot;Now? Probably on the way to the City. I will await your reply,&quot; he cackles as he walks away. The mob of villagers glare at Edgar, as he arrogantly strides away. When he is out of sight, the villagers begin to head back to their homes, grumbling to themselves.

You turn to the Mayor and he unlocks the door to his house. You follow him into the spacious mansion.

Station
The Station is slow and idle. The town is not an attraction, and the Station is merely a stop for business men who need work in the city, or visit home. You see only a few business men walking around, luggages in tow. Prominently in the center of the station is a large faded red ticket booth. Next to it is a small kiosk, selling beverages and food items. To the south is the Train, waiting to depart.  Leaning against one of the pillars is a tall lanky boy, who you recognize instantly: Felix. Next to him is a man in a black suit, who Felix merrily jokes with. What in the world?

You can see Black Suit and Felix here.

You are taken aback. They have Felix?

&quot;Your son, Felix?&quot;

&quot;Who else?!&quot; The mayor cries angrily. &quot;They want the damn rocks! Now they&apos;ve resorted to this trickery and blackmailing. What villains!&quot;

&quot;What can we do?&quot; You ask earnestly.

&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; he says as he shakes his head, &quot;Why don&apos;t we go into the house to speak.&quot;

&quot;Alright.&quot; The mayor turns to Edgar and says in his booming voice,

&quot;Enough!&quot; The crowd goes silent. &quot;Edgar. We will give you an answer soon. In the meantime, at least tell me where my son is.&quot;

Edgar laughs. &quot;Now? Probably on the way to the City. I will await your reply,&quot; he cackles as he walks away. The mob of villagers glare at Edgar, as he arrogantly strides away. When he is out of sight, the villagers begin to head back to their homes, grumbling to themselves.

You turn to the Mayor and he unlocks the door to his house. You follow him into the spacious mansion.

Mayor&apos;s House
When you walk into the house, you are stunned by the beautiful furnishing that seems to glitter in the house. At the center of the pearly marble white floor is a large glossy wooden table. Under a magnificent acrylic painting is a polished large leather sofa. The Mayor plops down on the sofa and deflates.

Station
The Station is slow and idle. The town is not an attraction, and the Station is merely a stop for business men who need work in the city, or visit home. You see only a few business men walking around, luggages in tow. Prominently in the center of the station is a large faded red ticket booth. Next to it is a small kiosk, selling beverages and food items. To the south is the Train, waiting to depart.  Leaning against one of the pillars is a tall lanky boy, who you recognize instantly: Felix. Next to him is a man in a black suit, who Felix merrily jokes with. What in the world?

&quot;Him,&quot; he points to Edgar. &quot;He just informed us that the Company has Felix.&quot;

You are taken aback. They have Felix?

&quot;Your son, Felix?&quot;

&quot;Who else?!&quot; The mayor cries angrily. &quot;They want the damn rocks! Now they&apos;ve resorted to this trickery and blackmailing. What villains!&quot;

&quot;What can we do?&quot; You ask earnestly.

&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; he says as he shakes his head, &quot;Why don&apos;t we go into the house to speak.&quot;

&quot;Alright.&quot; The mayor turns to Edgar and says in his booming voice,

&quot;Enough!&quot; The crowd goes silent. &quot;Edgar. We will give you an answer soon. In the meantime, at least tell me where my son is.&quot;

Edgar laughs. &quot;Now? Probably on the way to the City. I will await your reply,&quot; he cackles as he walks away. The mob of villagers glare at Edgar, as he arrogantly strides away. When he is out of sight, the villagers begin to head back to their homes, grumbling to themselves.

You turn to the Mayor and he unlocks the door to his house. You follow him into the spacious mansion.

Mayor&apos;s House
When you walk into the house, you are stunned by the beautiful furnishing that seems to glitter in the house. At the center of the pearly marble white floor is a large glossy wooden table. Under a magnificent acrylic painting is a polished large leather sofa. The Mayor plops down on the sofa and deflates.

Station
The Station is slow and idle. The town is not an attraction, and the Station is merely a stop for business men who need work in the city, or visit home. You see only a few business men walking around, luggages in tow. Prominently in the center of the station is a large faded red ticket booth. Next to it is a small kiosk, selling beverages and food items. To the south is the Train, waiting to depart.  Leaning against one of the pillars is a tall lanky boy, who you recognize instantly: Felix. Next to him is a man in a black suit, who Felix merrily jokes with. What in the world?

&quot;Him,&quot; he points to Edgar. &quot;He just informed us that the Company has Felix.&quot;

You are taken aback. They have Felix?

&quot;Your son, Felix?&quot;

&quot;Who else?!&quot; The mayor cries angrily. &quot;They want the damn rocks! Now they&apos;ve resorted to this trickery and blackmailing. What villains!&quot;

&quot;What can we do?&quot; You ask earnestly.

&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; he says as he shakes his head, &quot;Why don&apos;t we go into the house to speak.&quot;

&quot;Alright.&quot; The mayor turns to Edgar and says in his booming voice,

&quot;Enough!&quot; The crowd goes silent. &quot;Edgar. We will give you an answer soon. In the meantime, at least tell me where my son is.&quot;

Edgar laughs. &quot;Now? Probably on the way to the City. I will await your reply,&quot; he cackles as he walks away. The mob of villagers glare at Edgar, as he arrogantly strides away. When he is out of sight, the villagers begin to head back to their homes, grumbling to themselves.

You turn to the Mayor and he unlocks the door to his house. You follow him into the spacious mansion.

Mayor&apos;s House
When you walk into the house, you are stunned by the beautiful furnishing that seems to glitter in the house. At the center of the pearly marble white floor is a large glossy wooden dining table, on top of which is an elegant flower arrangement. Under a magnificent acrylic painting is a polished large leather sofa. The Mayor plops down on the sofa and deflates.

Station
The Station is slow and idle. The town is not an attraction, and the Station is merely a stop for business men who need work in the city, or visit home. You see only a few business men walking around, luggages in tow. Prominently in the center of the station is a large faded red ticket booth. Next to it is a small kiosk, selling beverages and food items. To the south is the Train, waiting to depart.  Leaning against one of the pillars is a tall lanky boy, who you recognize instantly: Felix. Next to him is a man in a black suit, who Felix merrily jokes with. What in the world?

&quot;You ignorant boy. What are you doing?&quot; You shout at him.

&quot;I&apos;m going to the city, Alex,&quot; he retorts. &quot;I&apos;m sick of that stupid village. I don&apos;t want to inherit the position of mayor when I have the potential to do so much more. Luckily, the Company realized this and offered to relocate me. They&apos;re bringing me to the city, it&apos;s going to be wonderful!&quot;

&quot;You don&apos;t understand. Right now the Company has told your father that they are holding you in their custody. They said that if the villagers don&apos;t yield the Lady&apos;s Flower, they&apos;ll harm you.&quot;

&quot;Don&apos;t joke with me. That old fart&apos;s probably willing to say anything to get me back to the village. And once they do, they&apos;ll never let me leave again.&quot;

&quot;You shut up! If the villagers do end up handing over the stones, they&apos;ll catch up and toss you back into the village. Please Felix, come to your sense.&quot;

&quot;No! I can&apos;t stay there. Even if your story is true, the villagers would never hand over the stupid rocks. They have too much prided for that!&quot; The speakers in the Station suddenly blare out:

&quot;Train 342 to the City is departing in 5 minutes-please board now. Thank you.&quot; Felix looks at you, then shoves you out of the way to gather his belongings.

The Station is slow and idle. The town is not an attraction, and the Station is merely a stop for business men who need work in the city, or visit home.

Next to it is a small kiosk, selling beverages and food items. To the south is the Train, waiting to depart.
