PHUD: <after player talks to mayor>: rule attachment mode RULE_IN_RULEBOOK_EFF
  Rule preamble: <after player talks to mayor>
  Rule parameter: <player talks to mayor>
  Owned by rulebook: Rulebook 23 (after)
  Placement: MIDDLE_PLACEMENT
Bad action pattern: player talks to mayor =   [Invalid]  Action: unspecified

PAP failure reason: 2
Problem PM_APWithNoParticiple issued from inform7/Chapter 28/Phrase Usage.w, line 787

  >--> You wrote 'After Player talks to Mayor' (source text, line 68), which
    seems to introduce a rule taking effect only 'Player talks to Mayor'. But
    this does not look like an action, since there is no sign of a participle
    ending '-ing' (as in 'taking the brick', say) - which makes me think I have
    badly misunderstood what you intended.
