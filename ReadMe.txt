	My goal for this game was to create a mystery novel-like game similar to those I have read before. However, this was easier said than done. In order to recreate a mystery, I first had to think of a plot. It was not easy, and the plot I came up with was VERY cliche. What I did, instead, was throw in lots of character plot-twists and descriptions. Hopefully that compensated for the stupid arc. I think my game is too long to be enjoyable, which frustrates me because I really tried to make it engaging and fun, but that’s never easy to do in such a short period of time. I am, however, very happy with the overall setting of my game. I spent a lot of time writing descriptions, which I think paints a vibrant and detailed set. I also managed to incorporate the NPC interaction and many items to examine and think about.
	One of the hardest problems I had was the conversation puzzle. Here, I had to use items to create a condition, which would then show a prompt if satisfied. At first, I wrote out almost everything… only to find out it didn’t work! I asked Mrs. Kiang about it, and she suggested I use a table menu. But I checked out the recipe book, and the table menu was beyond my comprehension and I realized I probably would not be able to execute it well. And so I persisted in what I had begun with the items, a risky move, considering the time I had. After looking through Brennan’s Pizza game, I found out how to use [end if]s, which fixed my problem! Although tedious to read through the code, having access to other’s games was extremely helpful.
	Game mechanics are relatively simple. I think everything is quite literal, so an experienced IF user should be able to maneuver through the game easily. I also include a lot of prompts into the conversations, so that the next step isn’t completely impossible to get. The conversation mimic table is an example of this, where prompts show up as the player gathers information.
	I asked four people to beta test my game. Only two, however, actually finished. The first two, Phillip Tanton and Cole Damon, were able to get to the Station. But they ran out of time. They helped catch a couple of grammar errors and minor bugs, which I was able to fix immediately.
